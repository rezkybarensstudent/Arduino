# Gas Leak Detector
Gas leak detector is devices that detect the presence of gas in an area, often as part of a security system. Gas detectors use a sensor to measure the concentration of particular gases in the atmosphere. The sensor serves as a reference point and scale, producing a measurable electric current when a chemical reaction caused by a specific gas occurs.

Some of the tools/materials needed to work on a gas leak detector project, such as:
- Arduino IDE
- Proteus Design Suite
- MQ-2/MQ-5 Gas Sensor
- LED - Green
- LED - Red
- Microcontroller (Arduino UNO R3)
- Power adapter
- Bell (Alarm)
- LCD
